**Project Abstract**    
The software will make a small game of wolf hunting sheep. In this game, the player will take on the role of a wolf, and try to catch as many sheep as possible in a limited time. Traps will be set inside the field, players need to avoid them and try to use them to catch sheep. The game will also include different modes for players to choose from Easy, Medium, Hard. In these modes, sheep have different moving speeds and appearance times. Before playing the game, players need to create their own accounts and log in each time for play. The number of caught sheep will be recorded and make the scoreboard of players.

**Customer**    
First of all, the primary users of our software are people who have some time to kill. For example, when a few friends get bored in queuing, they can play a game. Besides, different families going out to dinner before eating can let the children play a game, so the children will not interrupt adultsâ€™ conversation. The main customers are advertisers. After each round, advertisers push ads according to the registered age. In addition, customers can also be a social media software company, such as Facebook, Twitter, etc., because interactive games have natural social attributes and can provide topics to maintain social behavior. Furthermore, this small game is also a tool for strangers to start getting in touch with each other on social media apps.

**Competitive Analysis**    
Our web application is entertainment, so the possible competitors would be all the other games like snake game on a web browser. However, our game has different features than the traditional snake game. It has a precondition that requires the user to log in. Once the user logged in, each user would have a record appear on a leaderboard. Then, in the game, instead of a stationary target that the user needs to reach, the target in our game is moving randomly, so that the user needs to catch or chase the target. In addition to moving targets the game will include things like power-ups and traps. It also has a postcondition, when the game is over, the score would be automatically recorded on the leaderboard. Then, there would be multiple players competing with each other by comparing their scores on the leaderboard. Overall, our game is more competitive and fun to play.

**Iteration 1**    
For iteration1, we will implement the login page and main UI, which could choose different modes. For example, if users choose the easy mode, sheep are slower, and there are lots of power-ups and a few traps on the map. On the other hand, the hard mode has very fast sheep with few power-ups and lots of traps. In addition, we will create an administrator account. By logging into the administrator account, we can see the different users and their scores.
